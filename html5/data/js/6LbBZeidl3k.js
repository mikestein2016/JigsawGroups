Use jigsaw groups to digest more material in less time: \\nBreak up a reading or section of text into different parts. Assign each group a part of the reading and ask them to work in groups to read and come up with the most important points and quotes from the reading. Then mix up the groups (using jigsaw) to have students from each group teach students from the other groups. Reflect together as a class to ensure no important content was missed and to give feedback.\\n\\n2. Use jigsaw groups for critical thinking questions: \\nHave students form groups and answer critical thinking questions. Then mix the groups and have each member of the new group report out what the other group came up with and discuss differences in viewpoints and responses to the questions.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":25}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":670,"height":307,"strokewidth":0}},"width":670,"height":307,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6HcMLVETi2W"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
